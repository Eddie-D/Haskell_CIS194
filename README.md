## Purpose
A repository documenting my solutions to University of Pensylvania's [Haskell Course](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html) as I journey to learn the functional programming language.

### On Directories
Each assignment is stored in its own directory, this helps development by providing structured locations for compiled Haskell files which are not being committed.
